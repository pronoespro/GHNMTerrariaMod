"Gods have no mercy, so you have to destroy all of them."

In this mod, you'll be able to face more gods and even fight as a dark lord.
If you are weak against darkness, then don't install this mod, if not have fun.

If the gods find out about your objective, they will try to stop you.

It includes:
-Two more bosses (one for a specific class)
-A "brand" new weapon that is the upgrade to other two
-A new class that is based around mobility and defense (The more defense, the more damage)
-A new accesory that simplifies everything, but is tedious to craft and it's upgrade
-A new crafting bench (an altar, doesn't work as a demon altar)
-A new set of armour
